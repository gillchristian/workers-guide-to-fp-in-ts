- answer: what to expect to learn
- what you can do with these skills
- target audience
- what you need to know
- what you don't need to know
- how to approach this guide
- out of scope: won't talk about OO, we don't want to build strawmen arguments
- if you want to learn about FP: don't constantly compare it to OO if you can avoid it
- some things are fundamentally different, Scott Wlaschin jokingly compares this in his talks
- the answer to almost any question รก la "how do I do X in FP?" is "use a function"
