## you are

- being forced into functional programming by their coworkers
- seeks a practical introduction to FP without the math stuff
- wants to learn fp-ts and typed functional programming in typescript

## what you'll learn

- solving problems in a functional style
- introduce to the fp-ts ecosystem
- learning fundamental functional programming concepts:
    - pure functions
    - immutability
    - partial application
    - currying
    - composition
- skillset is mostly transferrable, not specific to typescript

## required knowledge

- solid understanding of javascript
- basic understanding of typescript

## how to approach this tutorial

* note on OOP:
* personally: I write in a functional style at work and a purely functional style in personal projects
* personal pet peev: guides on functional programming that build a strawman argument against OOP using what i would call "imperative code wrapped in classes"
* we may have some overly simplistic code examples to demonstrate pitfalls, if this resembles your style of OOP
* the reality is: FP design thinking is similar in _some_ aspects (e.g. how Haskell type classes resemble interfaces in OO), and _fundamentally different_ in others
* if you want to get the most out of this tutorial, try to empty your mind and don't constantly compare solutions to how you would do it in OOP, it won't do you much good, rather approach it like a beginner of programming

## work in progress

* as the author(s) of this guide are working fulltime, it will grow and evolve over time
